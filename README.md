Hey y’all! My name is Rachel Sanderlin. I recently decided to break into data science and blog about it along the way. This is my first blog ever, so thanks for coming along with me on this adventure! Today I’m going to write a bit about my personal and circuitous path into data science. 

## Growing Up ‘Bad at Math’

Data science wasn’t a career that I thought about until the past few months. Part of the reason that I didn’t consider it earlier was that I struggled to memorize multiplication tables in elementary school, and as such was labeled (and internalized) that I was ‘bad at math’. Throughout elementary school, I was also told, implicitly and explicitly, that I was an English person - smart enough, but math was something I should stay away from. 

### Failing College Statistics

As I got older, my self identification as an English (and therefore not a math) person  became more and more of a handicap. I shied away from careers or studies that included higher level math and felt adrift as to what type of career would be a good fit for me. Eventually, I chose to study psychology at [Bar Ilan University in Israel](https://www.biu.ac.il/en). The courses were all taught in Hebrew, a second language that I had haphazardly picked up over the years. That year, I took my first year of college statistics. It was the course I was most apprehensive about taking by far. I was incredibly nervous about taking a college level math class, and did everything in my power to learn as best as I could in Hebrew. I spent hours looking over and translating notes from Hebrew to English, I hired a weekly math tutor (who taught me in Hebrew), organized study groups with students in my class, and spent hours trying to piece together the lessons on my own. I wish I could say that this hard work led to a happy ending- but unfortunately it didn’t. After all that effort, I barely passed the class. While I did reasonably well in my other courses, I was so frustrated by my failure in statistics that I decided to take the class again. 

### Trying Statistics Again and Learning about Math Anxiety

After that challenging year, I switched to a [different university](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel which offered an international B.A. psychology program. This time around, with a statistics class taught in English, I was determined to not let math rock me. I was fortunate to have women professors and teaching assistants who spoke with me personally about gender stereotypes around math. They enlightened me about math anxiety, which women are more prone to and can hinder their pursuit of STEM careers. (One of these professors shared with me, “I teach math, but sometimes when someone asks me a math question out of the blue, my stomach drops. It takes me a minute to remember I do know how to do this - and not only that, but that I’m good at it.”) Hearing about these stereotypes and anxieties, along with studying in English, gave me the confidence to take another two semesters of statistics. By the end of the first semester, statistics was one of my favorite courses. So much so that I began to informally tutor other students before class on an ad-hoc basis.

### My Introduction to Data: Research!

	These experiences and conversations planted the seeds for me to feel comfortable taking on the math components of data science. Simultaneously, during my BA, I was offered the chance to run a research project under my mentors, Dr. Orna Sharon-Zagoory and Dr. Ruth Feldman at the [Center for Developmental and Social Neuroscience](https://ruthfeldmanlab.com/). This particular research focused on biomarkers and interpersonal reactions found in dyads of breastfeeding mothers and infants. I was responsible for recruiting participants, cleaning the data using SPSS, and collecting all of the physical samples and surveys at the participant’s homes.
  
After my research experience, I noticed that I really liked working with data and computers, but it had been drilled pretty hard into me that when you have a BA in psychology, there are only two traditional options; either you become a clinician or an academic researcher. 

While I loved my experience at the lab, I saw that there was limited upward mobility in the labs unless you became a professor with tenure. Until you reach those incredibly competitive positions (if at all) paid positions in academic research are tenuously balanced on the goodwill of your supervisor and the grant money that the lab applies for. Keeping this in mind, I recognized that I liked academia, but not enough to not enough to weather the precarious academic ladder. 

### The Road Not Taken: Social Work
Upon realizing this, I set out on the other ‘obvious’ career path: becoming a clinical therapist. I was accepted into a masters in social work program. While I thrived academically, after the first semester I realized I dreaded the emotional labor that is integral to a career as a social worker. Upon this realization I was at a loss. I didn’t know where to go from there. I began to brainstorm what other fields besides academic research and clinical therapy that I could see myself working in. 

Eventually, I began to trace what work I had most enjoyed in the past. One experience really stood out; working in the lab. But I had already nixed working in academia! I then began to look into getting a masters in statistics, but was wary of starting another graduate degree without any relevant job experience. Eventually, I stumbled upon data science and analytics, and decided to try it out. 

## Getting Started In Data Analytics And Data Science 

 I decided to apply for some part time jobs as a data analyst, so I could gain work experience and do a data science bootcamp simultaneously. I quickly got an entry position as a data analyst at a community mental health clinic due to my experience in Qualtrics, SPSS, and rudimentary R, and I am currently working there today. I’m also enrolled in a part time data science program through Flatiron.

That's my journey so far! I’ll be adding future posts about my forays into data science and analysis over the next few months.
